## Overview
![](file:///home/arjun/Desktop/90dd4b14-7e22-11e5-9592-5925348a7df9.png "Title")
DroneKit-Python (formerly DroneAPI-Python) contains the python language implementation of DroneKit.

The API allows developers to create Python apps that communicate with vehicles over MAVLink. It provides programmatic access to a connected vehicle's telemetry, state and parameter information, and enables both mission management and direct control over vehicle movement and operations. DroneKit-SITL is the fastest and easiest way to run SITL on Windows, Linux, or MAC OSX. 

The SITL (Software In The Loop) simulator allows you to create and test DroneKit-Python apps without a real vehicle. The ArduPilot SITL simulator allows you to simulate an ArduPilot based autopilot and communicate with it using MAVLink over the local IP network.
